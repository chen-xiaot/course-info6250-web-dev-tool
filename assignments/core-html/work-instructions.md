## Create a file named `basic.html`:

Do not worry about appearances on this exercise.  You should additional styling will come in later to make this look as desired.  You need only worry about the _structure_.  Make `basic.html` have:
* A section tag containing a div tag that...
    * ...contains 2 additional divs, with...
        * ...exactly one of the 2 innermost divs having the text content of: `inner`
    
## Create a file named `semantic.html`:

<<<<<<< HEAD
You are working to create an updated website for your company.  Before worrying about any appearances or styling, make `moderate.html` an example of a good HTML structure to represent the dropdown menu navigation in the page header.  There are 5 items in that main menu, but four of them expand to show different numbers of items on their list, while the 5th main menu entry has no dropdown.  Use any menu entries and names you want, but make such a structure.

## Create a file named `cascading.html` and a `cascading.css`:
Each of these gets harder, so try them one at a time.

* Have 6 divs, each with a number (1-6) inside
* You may add any ids and/or class names you need for this
* Have two CSS rules to change the background colors of box 1 (to light blue) and of box 2 (to light red).  These rules have the same result even if you swapped the order of the two rules.
<<<<<<< HEAD
* Have two CSS rules, changing the background color of box 3 (to light blue), and each trying to change box 4 (one to light blue like box 3, the other to light green).  Have it so if the rule changing everything to light blue is the rule that comes last, everything is light blue, but that rule is first of these two, then only box 3 is light blue and box 4 is light green)  swapping the order of these two rules, without changing anything else, should also switch between the two results.
* Have two CSS rules, one putting box 1 in a block in the upper-left of the screen while the other makes box 2 and box 3 light blue and light green, with each sitting next to each other, one taking up 2/3 width of the screen, and the other 1/3 width

Have it so if the rule changing both to light blue is the rule that comes last, both are light blue, but if that rule setting boxes to light blue is the first of these two rules, then only box 3 is light blue and box 4 is light green.  Swapping the order of these two rules, without changing anything else, should also switch between the two results.
* Have additional CSS rules to put box 1 in a block in the bottom-right of the screen while box 5 and box 6 are light blue and light green respectively, with each sitting next to each other, one taking up 2/3 width of the screen, and the other 1/3 width.

## Create a file named `boxes.html` and associated `boxes.css`:

Each of these gets harder, so try them one at a time.

<<<<<<< HEAD
* contains 3 divs that are not nested
* has a strong tag around the numbers 1, 2, and 3 as part of the content of the 3 divs
* each div also has a list of numbers inside.  Box 1 will have an ordered list of 3 items, box 2 will have an unordered list of 2 items, and box 3 will have an unordered list of two items that uses some other symbol instead of bullet points
* Box 1 will be a solid light red, while box 2 will get a black border with rounded corners, and Box 3 will not show the strong tag or its contents at all.

* Box 2 will have have the strong tag and its numeric contents be much larger, with the text being the color RGB code #C0FFEE
* Box 2 will have the 2nd list item (and only the 2nd) underlined using a selector involving a tag and two different classes but not an id.
